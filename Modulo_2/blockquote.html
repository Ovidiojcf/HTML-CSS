        According to an ancient indigenous legend, the guaraná plant was born from the tragic story of a young boy from the Sateré-Mawé tribe. The child, loved by his people, was envied by an evil spirit who took his life. Devastated, the gods took his eyes and planted them in the earth, giving rise to the guaraná vine. The fruit’s appearance, resembling an eye, symbolizes wisdom and protection. To this day, guaraná is considered a sacred gift, providing energy and vitality to those who consume it.
